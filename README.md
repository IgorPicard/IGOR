# Project Title: Melvor Idle - IGOR

## Project Description:

Greetings, esteemed modders! We're thrilled to introduce you to a pioneering modification project for Melvor Idle - meet IGOR, your In-Game Operative Guide for Optimal Routing. But remember, it's "eeegor", not "iGOR"!

Here's a snapshot of what IGOR aims to achieve:

- **Narrative Enrichment**: IGOR isn't just a guide, he's a storyteller. As players progress through the game, IGOR narrates an engaging story, bringing a new depth to the Melvor Idle universe.
- **Guided Progression**: IGOR presents a series of tasks to players, designed to explore the full depth of Melvor Idle's gameplay mechanics while ensuring an optimal path to progression.
- **Player Agency**: While IGOR offers guidance, he understands the joy of free will. Players are free to stray from the suggested path, paving their own unique adventure.
- **Dbox Integration**: With the power of Dbox base mod, IGOR communicates through interactive dialogue pop-ups, offering players intriguing options and decisions to make.
- **Personalized Journal Entries**: Every choice matters. At the end of each region, players receive a journal entry that reflects their chosen path and decisions, making every playthrough unique and personal.

I'm seeking contributors who are passionate about Melvor Idle and have a vision for enhancing its gaming experience. IGOR's blueprint is flexible, open for modifications, enhancements, and, most importantly, your creative input. 

Whether you're a seasoned modder or a gifted storyteller, I'd love for you to be a part of IGORâ€™s upbringing. Remember, it's not just about building a mod, it's about making a difference in the Melvor Idle community.

So join me, and let's build something remarkable together with our friendly assistant, IGOR. We look forward to seeing your invaluable contributions to this exciting project!
